# GenderProbability
The purpose of this project is to calculate the probability of the gender of a child by reading a text file. 

We're supposed to read a text file and utilize tokens in our if else statement to make the program work. 

This project allows us to use Counter to understand the probability of getting a boy, a girl, or both.

<+s>: This program helped me understand how to read a text file. 

<-s>: In addition, I did have to overcome certain barriers such as (some things took me time to learn) which was good because I am still learning. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding how to do this will help me in the future.

I read the test1.txt and test2.txt files to calculate the probability of the BB, GG, BG, or GB in the two files. 
test1.txt has a total of 10 families while test2.txt has a total of 25 families. 

I also learned the importance of while loops, and the purpose of counter++.
